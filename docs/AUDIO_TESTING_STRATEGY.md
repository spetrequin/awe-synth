# Audio Synthesis Testing Strategy

## Problem Statement

Current testing shows "success" but produces 0/1024 non-zero audio samples. We have false positives where:
- MIDI events are queued ✓
- Voices are allocated ✓  
- Filter coefficients calculated ✓
- Effects parameters set ✓
- **But NO audio samples generated** ❌

## Comprehensive Audio Testing Requirements

### 1. Sample-Level Validation Tests

**Test: Raw Sample Data Integrity**
- Verify SoundFont samples contain non-zero data
- Check sample bit depth conversion (i16 → f32)
- Validate sample rate and loop points
- Ensure sample arrays aren't empty or corrupted

**Test: Sample Interpolation**
- Test 4-point interpolation with known input samples
- Verify playback position advancement
- Check loop boundary handling
- Validate pitch shifting affects playback rate

### 2. Voice-Level Synthesis Tests

**Test: Zone Selection & Activation** 
- Verify zones are created for MIDI note/velocity
- Check zone amplitude calculations
- Validate key/velocity range matching
- Test fallback test tone generation

**Test: Sample Generation Pipeline**
```
Raw Sample Data → Interpolation → Zone Mixing → Envelope → Filter → Effects → Output
```

**Test: Envelope Processing**
- Verify ADSR envelope generates non-zero values
- Check envelope state transitions (Off → Attack → Decay → Sustain → Release)
- Test envelope timing at different velocities
- Validate envelope affects final output amplitude

### 3. Buffer-Level Integration Tests

**Test: Audio Buffer Processing**
- Generate known input (sine wave, test tone)
- Process through complete synthesis pipeline  
- Verify output buffer contains expected non-zero samples
- Check sample values are within valid range (-1.0 to 1.0)

**Test: MIDI Event → Audio Output Chain**
```
MIDI Note On → Voice Allocation → Zone Selection → Sample Generation → Audio Buffer → Validation
```

### 4. End-to-End Validation Tests

**Test: Golden Reference Comparison**
- Generate audio from known MIDI sequence
- Compare against pre-recorded reference audio
- Validate frequency content, amplitude, timing
- Detect synthesis pipeline regressions

**Test: Real-time Performance Validation**
- Measure actual samples generated per second
- Verify 44.1kHz sample rate compliance
- Check for buffer underruns or timing issues
- Validate polyphonic load handling

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Diagnostic Tests (Immediate)
```rust
// Test raw sample data
test_sample_data_integrity()
test_sample_interpolation() 
test_zone_selection()
test_envelope_generation()
```

### Phase 2: Pipeline Tests  
```rust
// Test synthesis pipeline stages
test_voice_sample_generation()
test_audio_buffer_processing()
test_midi_to_audio_chain()
```

### Phase 3: Integration Tests
```rust
// Test complete system
test_polyphonic_synthesis()
test_performance_benchmarks()
test_golden_reference_comparison()
```

## Test Failure Criteria

Tests should FAIL if:
- Audio buffer contains all zeros
- Sample interpolation returns zeros for non-zero input
- Envelope generator stuck at zero amplitude
- Voice allocation succeeds but produces no audio
- MIDI events processed but no corresponding audio output
- Performance falls below real-time requirements

## Success Metrics

- **Audio Generation**: >80% of samples non-zero for sustained notes
- **Amplitude Range**: Sample values between -1.0 and 1.0
- **Frequency Accuracy**: ±1Hz for test tones
- **Timing Precision**: Sample-accurate MIDI event processing
- **Performance**: 32-voice polyphony at 44.1kHz without dropouts

This testing strategy will catch the current "looks good but silent" issue and prevent similar regressions.
