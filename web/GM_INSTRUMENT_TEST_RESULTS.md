## Test Features

### Interactive Testing:
1. **Visual Instrument Grid**: Click any instrument to hear it
2. **Category-based Testing**: Test instruments by musical category
3. **Automated Testing**: Complete 128-instrument test sequence
4. **Drum Kit Testing**: Test all drum kits and individual drum notes
5. **Program Change Testing**: Rapid program change validation
6. **Bank Select Testing**: MSB/LSB bank selection + program change

### Automated Validation:
- **MIDI Message Verification**: Track program change, bank select, note on/off messages
- **Speed Testing**: Measure program change response times
- **Channel Isolation**: Verify different instruments on different channels
- **Drum Kit Switching**: Test drum kit program changes on Channel 10
- **Complete Coverage**: Test all 128 instruments systematically

## Expected Results

### Success Criteria:
- ✅ All 128 GM instruments respond to program changes
- ✅ Correct MIDI program change messages sent (0xC0-0xCF)
- ✅ Audio output changes based on selected instrument
- ✅ Drum kits work correctly on Channel 10
- ✅ Bank select + program change combinations work
- ✅ Visual feedback for selected instruments
- ✅ No stuck notes or MIDI message errors

### Performance Requirements:
- Program change response < 100ms
- No audio dropouts during instrument switching
- Clean transitions between instruments
- Proper channel isolation (16 independent channels)

## How to Run Tests

### Server Running:
```bash
# Server already running at http://localhost:3000
```

### Test URLs:
- **Interactive GM Test**: `http://localhost:3000/web/test-gm-instruments.html`
- **Main Application**: `http://localhost:3000/web/index.html`

### Manual Testing Steps:
1. Open the GM instrument test page
2. Click "Test All 128 Instruments" for automated testing
3. Or click individual instruments in the grid
4. Test drum kits using the Channel 10 selector
5. Verify program changes and bank select functionality

### Integration with Main App:
The main application should have:
- Instrument selector dropdown/interface
- Program change functionality on all 16 MIDI channels
- Drum kit selection for Channel 10
- Visual feedback for current instrument
- Integration with the synthesis engine

## Implementation Details

### MIDI Messages Generated:
- **Program Change**: `0xC0 | channel, program`
- **Bank Select MSB**: `0xB0 | channel, 0x00, bank`
- **Bank Select LSB**: `0xB0 | channel, 0x20, 0x00`
- **Note On**: `0x90 | channel, note, velocity`
- **Note Off**: `0x80 | channel, note, 0x00`

### Test Categories:
1. **Initialization**: Verify GM instrument definitions loaded
2. **Program Changes**: Test all 128 program change commands
3. **Drum Kits**: Test Channel 10 drum kit selection
4. **Bank Select**: Test bank switching functionality
5. **Channel Isolation**: Verify multi-channel operation
6. **Speed Testing**: Measure program change performance

## Next Steps
After verifying all GM instruments work correctly, proceed to:
- 18.1.3: Test CC controls (pitch bend, mod wheel, sustain)
- 18.1.4: Verify velocity sensitivity mapping
- Integration testing with SoundFont preset switching

## Technical Notes
- All 128 GM instruments are standardized across devices
- Channel 10 is reserved for drum/percussion sounds
- Bank select allows access to additional sound banks
- Program changes should be immediate (< 100ms response)
- Multiple channels can play different instruments simultaneously
