## 🚨 Known Issues & Workarounds

### Generic USB MIDI Drivers
**Problem**: Windows/Mac generic drivers can cause timing issues
**Symptoms**: High latency, occasional stuck notes
**Solution**: Install manufacturer-specific drivers

### WebMIDI Browser Support
**Chrome**: Full support, excellent performance
**Firefox**: No WebMIDI support - use virtual keyboard
**Safari**: Limited WebMIDI support
**Edge**: Full support (Chromium-based)

### Common Device Issues

#### Timing Jitter
**Affected Devices**: Budget controllers, older devices
**Symptoms**: Inconsistent note timing, audio dropouts
**Solutions**:
- Reduce audio buffer size
- Use dedicated USB port
- Update device firmware
- Close unnecessary applications

#### SysEx Limitations
**Affected Devices**: Some controllers and vintage devices
**Symptoms**: Program changes don't work, limited sound selection
**Solutions**:
- Use alternative program change methods
- Check device SysEx documentation
- Enable SysEx in device settings

#### Power Management Issues
**Affected Devices**: USB-powered devices
**Symptoms**: Intermittent connections, device dropouts
**Solutions**:
- Use powered USB hub
- Disable USB power management
- Connect directly to computer (avoid hubs)

## 🔧 Optimization Tips

### Audio Settings
```javascript
// Optimal audio context settings
const audioContext = new AudioContext({
    sampleRate: 44100,
    latencyHint: 'interactive'
});

// For low-latency performance
const bufferSize = 256; // Reduce for lower latency
```

### MIDI Settings
```javascript
// Request MIDI access with SysEx support
const midiAccess = await navigator.requestMIDIAccess({
    sysex: true
});

// Optimize input handling
input.onmidimessage = (event) => {
    // Process immediately, don't queue
    processMIDIMessage(event);
};
```

### Device-Specific Optimizations

#### Roland Devices
- Enable "PC1" mode for better program change support
- Use "MIDI" output mode instead of "USB AUDIO"
- Set velocity curve to "MEDIUM" for best response

#### Yamaha Devices
- Set "MIDI OUT" to "USB" in device settings
- Enable "LOCAL OFF" to prevent double triggering
- Use "PERFORM" mode for real-time playing

#### M-Audio Devices
- Install M-Audio drivers (not Windows generic)
- Set buffer size to 256 samples or lower
- Disable "MIDI feedback" in device software
